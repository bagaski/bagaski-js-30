# bagaski-js-30
Bagaski's exploration of Wesbos's https://javascript30.com/ course

This is my own method of working with the fantastic course by wesbos. Here is the site https://javascript30.com with all the videos. I will mostly focus on some projects in particular that i find more interesting and I will be quite slow while working on each project, since I would like to not only deeply understand the use of JavaScript in each case but also improve on the design and also take a step further and enhance the projects - since some of them have a lot of creative potential. I have also rename each project slightly in order to have it making sense more to me. However i keep the same numbering for each project to keep aligned to the original material.

This is work in progress and I still don't know how this will develop so it might form a website with a collection of the projects I created or it might lead to independent apps or websites. But my aim is to merge my creative coding practice with my JavaScript learning process.

Let's get started!
